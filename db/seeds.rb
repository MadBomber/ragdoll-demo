    title: "Introduction to Machine Learning",
    content: <<~TEXT
      Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

      The field encompasses various approaches including:
      - Supervised learning: Training models with labeled data
      - Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
      - Reinforcement learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

      Key concepts include:
      - Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming input variables
      - Model selection: Choosing appropriate algorithms for specific tasks
      - Cross-validation: Evaluating model performance on unseen data
      - Overfitting and underfitting: Balancing model complexity and generalization

      Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

    title: "Ruby on Rails Best Practices",
    content: <<~TEXT
      Ruby on Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

      Key principles and best practices:
      - Convention over Configuration: Rails provides sensible defaults
      - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicating code
      - Fat Models, Skinny Controllers: Keep business logic in models
      - RESTful design: Use standard HTTP methods and resource-oriented URLs

      Database best practices:
      - Use migrations for database schema changes
      - Add proper indexes for query performance
      - Use database constraints for data integrity
      - Implement proper associations between models

      Testing approaches:
      - Unit tests for models and helpers
      - Integration tests for controllers
      - Feature tests for user workflows
      - Use factories instead of fixtures for test data

      Performance optimization:
      - Use eager loading to avoid N+1 queries
      - Implement caching strategies
      - Optimize database queries
      - Use background jobs for long-running tasks

    title: "Vector Embeddings and Semantic Search",
    content: <<~TEXT
      Vector embeddings are dense numerical representations of words, phrases, or documents that capture semantic meaning in a high-dimensional space.

      How embeddings work:
      - Text is converted into numerical vectors
      - Similar concepts are positioned close together in vector space
      - Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors
      - Lower angles indicate higher semantic similarity

      Applications:
      - Semantic search: Finding documents by meaning rather than keywords
      - Recommendation systems: Suggesting similar items
      - Natural language processing: Understanding context and relationships
      - Information retrieval: Improving search relevance

      Popular embedding models:
      - OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and text-embedding-3-large
      - Sentence-BERT for sentence-level embeddings
      - Universal Sentence Encoder by Google
      - Custom domain-specific embeddings

      Implementation considerations:
      - Choosing appropriate embedding dimensions
      - Handling out-of-vocabulary words
      - Updating embeddings for new data
      - Balancing accuracy and computational cost

    title: "Database Optimization Strategies",
    content: <<~TEXT
      Database optimization is crucial for application performance and scalability.

      Indexing strategies:
      - B-tree indexes for equality and range queries
      - Hash indexes for exact matches
      - Composite indexes for multi-column queries
      - Partial indexes for filtered data

      Query optimization:
      - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans
      - Avoid SELECT * in production code
      - Use appropriate JOIN types
      - Implement proper WHERE clause filtering

      Database design principles:
      - Normalize to eliminate data redundancy
      - Denormalize for read performance when appropriate
      - Use appropriate data types
      - Implement proper constraints

      Performance monitoring:
      - Track slow queries
      - Monitor connection pool usage
      - Analyze query frequency and patterns
      - Set up alerts for performance degradation

      Scaling approaches:
      - Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
      - Sharding for horizontal scaling
      - Connection pooling for resource management
      - Caching strategies to reduce database load

    title: "API Design and Documentation",
    content: <<~TEXT
      Well-designed APIs are essential for modern web applications and microservices architectures.

      RESTful API principles:
      - Use HTTP methods appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
      - Implement proper status codes
      - Design resource-oriented URLs
      - Use consistent naming conventions

      Authentication and authorization:
      - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
      - Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication
      - Implement role-based access control
      - Secure sensitive endpoints

      Documentation best practices:
      - Use OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
      - Provide clear examples and use cases
      - Document error responses
      - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

      Versioning strategies:
      - URL versioning (e.g., /v1/users)
      - Header versioning
      - Parameter versioning
      - Plan for backward compatibility

      Performance considerations:
      - Implement pagination for large datasets
      - Use appropriate caching headers
      - Optimize JSON serialization
      - Implement rate limiting
