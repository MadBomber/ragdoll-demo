# Ragdoll Demo Documentation

Welcome to the Ragdoll Demo documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding, using, and deploying the Ragdoll Demo application - a full-featured Rails application that demonstrates the complete capabilities of the Ragdoll document processing and semantic search system.

## Quick Start

The Ragdoll Demo is a Rails 8.0.2+ application that showcases intelligent document processing, vector embeddings, and semantic search capabilities. To get started quickly:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the application.
