# Test Document

This is a test document to verify the progress tracking system is working correctly.

The progress bar should update as this document is processed, showing:
1. File upload status
2. Processing progress
3. Completion with checkmark

If you see this document in the system with proper real-time updates, the progress tracking is working.
