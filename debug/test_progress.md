# Real-time Progress Test

This document is used to test the real-time progress tracking system.

The system should show:
1. ✅ File upload via fetch API  
2. ✅ ActionCable WebSocket connection
3. ✅ Real-time progress updates (0% → 25% → 75% → 100%)
4. ✅ Individual file status indicators
5. ✅ Overall progress bar updates
6. ✅ Success checkmarks and completion

If you can see this document processed with real-time updates, the progress tracking system is working correctly!
